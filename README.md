# GraphingCalculator
This is a quadratic calculator programmed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

This program solves for the equation ax^2 + bx + c by solving for:
  1) The discriminant
  2) The axis of symmetry
  3) The vertex

This program will also solve for the roots.

If the discriminant > 0, there are 2 real roots

If the discriminant < 0, there are 2 imaginary roots

If the discriminant = 0, there is only 1 real root

Finally, this program will also graph the quadratic equation
